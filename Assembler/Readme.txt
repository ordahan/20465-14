1. Makefile - 
Contains 2 configurations:
 * all - What should be run by the tester.
 * test - My own unit-testing for the project, should run ok as well but not 
 		  taken into account as a part of the code required.

2. Files that start with 'test_' -
Same as the makefile, these are just meant for unit-testing.
I provided them together with the code if the tester would like to run them
as well.

3. 'tests' folder - 
Files used for the various testings.

4. 'inputs' & 'outputs' folder -
Runtime examples for the tester (including a shell log for some of them).
